1. Autoboxing and Unboxing

ðŸ‘‰ Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of a primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class object.
ðŸ‘‰ Unboxing is the reverse â€” automatically converting an object back into a primitive
Why itâ€™s useful:

Makes code cleaner

Allows primitives to be used in collections (like ArrayList<Integer>) that work with objects only.
2. Serialization

ðŸ‘‰ Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, so it can be saved to a file or sent over a network.
ðŸ‘‰ Deserialization is the reverse â€” converting byte stream back to an object.

To make a class serializable, it must implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
Why itâ€™s useful:

Saving object state permanently

Sending objects over network (e.g., in distributed systems)

ðŸŸ¦ 3. File Handling

ðŸ‘‰ File handling in Java allows reading from and writing to files using classes from java.io package.

File â†’ represents file or directory path

FileWriter, BufferedWriter â†’ write data

FileReader, BufferedReader â†’ read data
âœ… Why itâ€™s useful:

Storing data persistently

Processing external data files

Creating logs or reports
